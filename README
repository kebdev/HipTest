Installation:
    Use conda or virtualenv; they are similar tools. The instructions below are for conda.

    These instructions have been tested for a Mac. If you're running Windows, it should be similar but I haven't tested it.

    Create a conda environment and activate it:
        conda create -n hiptest python=2.7 flask beautiful-soup urllib3
        source activate hiptest

    Run the server. To run it locally, just use
        python hip.py

    To run it in Production (not tested), you would run it in the background and redirect output.

Usage:
    By default, this runs on port 5000. an example URL is
        http://localhost:5000/content/@kevin @monica (ladios)

Improvements:
    1. Use better logging
    2. Remove the @ signs from the mentions and remove the parentheses from the emoticons
    3. If the URL is not found, it is just ignored. Discuss with the Product Owner what the correct behavior should be
    4. The ordering in the exercise is mentions, emoticons, links; in my output, it's emoticons, links, mentions
         (alphabetical order). If this is a problem, fix it.
    5. Fix this warning: "Unverified HTTPS request is being made. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised. See: https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-usage.html#ssl-warnings"
    6. Could not get links to work with a GET request. Change to POST. Hard-coded a couple links to verify that the page title was handled correctly.
    7. Testing was all done manually using a browser. Write a cURL script to test automatically.
    8. Look at using Requests instead of urllib3.
    9. Write a short script to start it in Production, activating the environment and redirecting output (unless better logging implemented; see #1).
