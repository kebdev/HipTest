Installation:
    Use conda or virtualenv; they are similar tools. The instructions below are for conda.

    These instructions have been tested for a Mac. If you're running Windows, it should be similar but I haven't tested it.

    Create a conda environment and activate it:
        conda create -n hiptest python=2.7 flask beautiful-soup requests
        source activate hiptest

    Run the server. To run it locally, just use
        python hip.py

    To run it in Production (not tested), you would run it in the background and redirect output.

Usage:
    By default, this runs on port 5000. an example URL is
        http://localhost:5000/api/msg?@chris you around?

Improvements:
    2. Add a mechanism for health reporting, that returns usages for CPU, mem, HDD, network
    3. Add a cache for URLs, since fetching them is expensive
    4. The ordering in the exercise is: mentions, emoticons, links. Verify this matches the jsonify output
    5. Unit testing is currently in msg.py. Add tests using cURL scripts or the equivalent.
    6. Write a short script to start it in Production, activating the environment and redirecting output (unless better logging implemented; see #1).
    7. Add a method for login
    8. Add a capability for throttling users, to prevent DoS
    9. Think about how to prevent a user from entering a malicious URL
    10. Send gzipped json back instead of cleartext json
