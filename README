Installation:
    Use conda or virtualenv; they are similar tools. The instructions below are for conda.

    These instructions have been tested for a Mac. If you're running Windows, it should be similar but I haven't tested it.

    Create a conda environment and activate it:
        conda create -n hiptest python=2.7 flask beautiful-soup requests psutil repoze.lru
        source activate hiptest

    Run the server. To run it locally, just use
        python hip.py

    To run it in Production (not tested), you would run it in the background and redirect output.

Usage:
    By default, this runs on port 5000. an example URL is
        http://localhost:5000/api/msg?@chris you around?

Improvements:
    1. Create py.test unit tests from existing tests in msg.py
    2. Add tests using cURL scripts or the equivalent for integration testing.
    3. Create a concept of a user
    4. Add a method for login
    5. Add a capability for throttling users, to prevent DoS
    6. Use virustotal to determine if malicious or not before calling GET
    7. Write a short script to start it in Production, activating the environment and redirecting output.
