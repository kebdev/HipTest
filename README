Installation:
    Use conda or virtualenv; they are similar tools. The instructions below are for conda.

    These instructions have been tested for a Mac. If you're running Windows, it should be similar but I haven't tested it.

    Create a conda environment and activate it:
        conda create -n hiptest python=2.7 flask beautiful-soup urllib3 pyOpenSSL cryptography idna certifi
        source activate hiptest

    Run the server. To run it locally, just use
        python hip.py

    To run it in Production (not tested), you would run it in the background and redirect output.

Usage:
    By default, this runs on port 5000. an example URL is
        http://localhost:5000/content/"@chris you around?"

Improvements:
    1. Use better logging
    2. If the URL is not found, it is just ignored. Discuss with the Product Owner what the correct behavior should be
    3. The ordering in the exercise is: mentions, emoticons, links. In my output, it's: emoticons, links, mentions
         (alphabetical order). If this is a problem, fix it.
    4. Could not get links to work with a GET request. Change to POST.
    5. Unit testing is currently in msg.py. Once #6 is fixed, test using cURL scripts or the equivalent.
    6. Look at using Requests instead of urllib3.
    7. Write a short script to start it in Production, activating the environment and redirecting output (unless better logging implemented; see #1).
